# PowerScanner
### DISCLAIMER: The malware signatures/hashes' link(s) written on the Python script belongs to VirusShare, not me. If you have problems, just write them in the "issues" tab or ask the web.
PowerScanner is a simple virus scanner that scans the directory you've entered and checks if there is a match with the malicious hashes. That's all!
